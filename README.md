Global Citizen is a movement of engaged citizens who are using their collective voice to end extreme poverty by 2030. Through our mix of content and events, grassroots organizing, and our action platform, we are building a movement to end poverty. We organize massive global campaigns to amplify the actions of Global Citizens from around the world.

Since 2011, I and millions of Global Citizens around the world have taken over 24 million actions to targeting world leaders to end extreme poverty by 2030. To date, the actions by our global community along with our high level advocacy efforts and with our partners, have resulted commitments and policy announcements from leaders, valued at over $48 billion that have impacted more than 880 million people.
